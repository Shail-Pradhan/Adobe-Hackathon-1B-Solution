# Approach Explanation

This project solves the problem of finding the most contextually relevant, task-specific parts out of a collection of diverse PDF files, in accordance with a user persona and a job-to-be-done explanation. The approach is meant to be resilient over a range of domains—like food planning, travel, academic studies, business analysis, and educational review—yet extensible and simple to customize for new applications.

## Methodology

### 1. **PDF Parsing and Section Identification**

The extraction pipeline starts with a read of the text from each PDF through the `PyPDF2` library, allowing for page-by-page text extraction without needing commercial software. Each page's text is then divided into logical sections. Section boundaries are identified through rule-based formatting conventions (e.g., headings in title-case, numbered section headers, or bullet points). This way, even in documents with little formatting, individual topics or recipes are differentiated.

### 2. **Contextual Filtering and Constraint Enforcement**

The core aspect of this solution is context-aware filtering. In domains such as food/menu planning, the pipeline analyzes the job-to-be-done to identify dietary constraints (e.g., "vegetarian," "vegan," "gluten-free"). The pipeline eliminates any section in which prohibited ingredients or phrases occur, employing direct ingredient list extraction as well as keyword scanning within the entire section content. This reduces the chances of adding irrelevant or prohibited material, like meat recipes in a vegetarian menu, and can be applied to other content restrictions when necessary.

For other spaces, the code adjusts dynamically by deriving focus keywords from persona and job-to-be-done. For example, in academic circles, it enhances the weighting of sections with "methodology," "benchmark," or "results"; for business analysis, it seeks "revenue," "R&D," or "market positioning." Such keywords are meshed with semantic analysis to determine the most applicable content.

### 3. **Semantic Relevance and Ranking**

In order to make sure the output is not just compliant with the constraints but also topically relevant, the methodology uses TF-IDF vectorization from `scikit-learn`. It calculates semantic similarity scores between every section (and overall document) and a query built out of the persona and job description. The ranking function is a custom mix of keyword matching (for rapid, high-priority relevance) and TF-IDF scores for candidate sections.

### 4. **Diversity and Output Structuring**

The answer imposes diversity in the output to cover as many documents as possible and prevent redundancy. The best-ranked sections—preferably one each from a different document—are chosen and post-processed next to sanitize formatting and condense into informative summaries. The output is a JSON output that is formatted, containing metadata, an array of extracted sections, and a cleaned snippet from each.

### 5. **Extensibility and Generalization**

The design is extensible. Support for new domains can be achieved by the addition of appropriate keywords or filter rules, with no modification to the underlying logic. The codebase is structured as modules, and it is easy to add additional context-dependent constraints or ranking rules in the future.

## Conclusion

In total, this method blends rule-based filtering, keyword extraction, and semantic ranking to provide strong, contextually relevant section extraction from large datasets of PDF files.
